            <h2>History of Chinese Chess</h2>
            <p>Chinese Chess, also known as Xiangqi, is believed to have originated in China during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 CE). It is one of the oldest and most popular board games in China.</p>
            <p>The game was originally played by soldiers, who used pieces that represented military units such as chariots, horses, and soldiers. These pieces were moved on a board with nine vertical lines and ten horizontal lines.</p>
            <p>Over time, the game evolved and became more complex. New pieces were added, and the rules were refined. Today, Chinese Chess is played by millions of people all over the world.</p>

            <h2>Rules of Chinese Chess</h2>
            <p>Chinese Chess is played on a board with 9 rows and 10 columns. Each player starts with 16 pieces: a General, 2 Advisors, 2 Elephants, 2 Horses, 2 Chariots, 2 Cannons, and 5 Soldiers. The objective of the game is to checkmate your opponent's General piece.</p>
            <p>Each piece moves in a different way. For example, the General can only move within the Palace, while the Chariot can move horizontally or vertically any number of spaces.</p>
            <p>There are also special rules in Chinese Chess, such as the rule that a player cannot make a move that puts their General in check or exposes their General to attack by the opponent.</p>
