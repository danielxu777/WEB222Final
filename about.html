            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Chinese Chess is one of my favorite games to play. I grew up playing it with my family and friends, and it holds a special place in my heart. That's why I decided to create this website dedicated to the game.</p>
            <p>This website was created for a web development class, and it allowed me to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope you enjoy exploring the site and learning more about Chinese Chess.</p>
