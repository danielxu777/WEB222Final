            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My name is Haoxiang, I am currently in CPP program. My major was finance and accounting in university. After years of work, I am interested in programming now and programming is a big challenge for me, but I will do my best to be a good programmer.</p>
            <p>When I was a child, my parents rarely play games with me, so when the topic was given, a picture of memeory not that clear but exist came out. </p><p>It was a screen that when I was a little boy, my father taught me how to play Chinese chess. Chinese chess is not hard to play, so I had a very good time play with my dad.  </p>
            <p>This website was created for an assignment of course WEB222, and it allowed me to show my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope you enjoy exploring the site and learning more about Chinese Chess.</p>
